### History
MARKUS was originally developed as part of the project [Communication and Empire] [1] (funded by the European Research Council). It was first designed to automate the markup of different kinds of named entities (personal names, place names, temporal references, and official titles), and currently exists in beta with the funding provided through the [NEH-DID][2] scheme.
